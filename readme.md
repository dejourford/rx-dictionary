<h1>PURPOSE</h1>
This application is going to serve as the API for my eventual 100 Hours full-stack project. This application will test my abilities to create my own API that can be consumed by the public. I will store all of the drugs in this API so that I don't have to do it in my actual 100-Hours project; I will just fetch this api. Most importantly, ANYONE can use it. 

<h1>HOW IT'S MADE</h1>
--HTML
<br>
--NodeJS
<br>
--Express
<br>

<h1>LESSONS LEARNED</h1>
--learned you can't use netlify to host a server; heroku works. 
<br>
--don't forget to create the procfile so heroku knows to run the server for the app



<h1>IMPROVEMENTS</h1>
--refactor code if possible
